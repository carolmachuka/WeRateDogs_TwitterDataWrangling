# WeRateDogs_TwitterDataWrangling
### Introduction
The project aims at wrangling 3 sources of data. Data cleaning process is done meticulously with aim of attaining a tidy master data frame for analysis.
### Gathering data
The project wrangles 3 sources of data; Twitter archive enhanced.csv that has been provided by Udacity, Image predictions.tsv that is accessed through web scraping from the udacity servers and twitter. Authorization for elevated access of twitter data was processed before querying twitter favorite count, retweet count and full text based on the tweet id in the tweet df data frame.
### Assessing data
The 3 data frames were assessed during the cleaning process. However, twitter archive had more issues arising as compared to the other data frames. This were the issues that were flagged during the assessment
### 1)Quality

### a) Twitter archive table
- Anomalous numerator ratings that are above 30
- Anomalous denominator ratings that are not equal to 10
- Finding tweet id with original rating (no retweet)
- Nulls represented as None in columns puppo, floofer, pupper and doggo
- Nulls represented as 'none' in the column name. Given the available data, nothing much can be done about this
- Erroneous datatypes for columns puppo,floofer,pupper and doggo
- Dogs named as 'a'
- Retaining only relevant columns for analysis
- Erroneous datatypes for timestamp column
### b) Image predictions table
- Some predictions are not for a dog
- Inconsistencies of p1_dog, p2_dog and p3_dog values
### c)tweet df
- Rename 'id' column to tweet id for uniformity across all the data frames
#### 2)Tidiness
- Eliminate duplicated tweet id column in the 3 data frames by having a single
data frame
- Columns puppo, doggo, floofer and pupper should be one column called dog
stage

The final tidy master data frame was twitter archive master. This was the piece that was
used to transform the data to valuable insights through analysis and visualization.
### Weakness of the data
Itâ€™s important to note that a large majority of the dogs missed information about the dog
stages. That was a major setback for our analysis as this reduced our sample size
tremendously.
